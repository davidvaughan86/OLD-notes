# You go to stay at a hotel, but discover that some of the rooms are haunted!
# Each of the rooms has a different cost, and some of them are free, but there's a rumour 
# that all the free rooms are haunted! Since you've played too much Phasmophobia, you
# refuse to stay in any of the free rooms, or any of the rooms below any of the free rooms.

# Given the variable matrix, a rectangular matrix of integers, where each value represents the cost of 
# the room, your task is to return the total sum of all rooms that are suitable to stay in 
# (ie: add up all the values that don't appear in a column below a 0).

# Example

matrix = [[0, 1, 1, 2], 
          [0, 5, 0, 0], 
          [2, 0, 3, 3]]

# the output should be matrixElementsSum(matrix) = 9.
# 1 + 5 + 1 + 2 = 9.


matrix2 = [[1, 1, 1, 0], 
          [0, 5, 0, 1], 
          [2, 1, 3, 10]]

# the output should be matrixElementsSum(matrix2) = 9.

# Note that the free room in the final column makes the full column unsuitable for bots
# (not just the room directly beneath it). Thus, the answer is 1 + 1 + 1 + 5 + 1 = 9.

def matrixElementsSum(matrix):
    
    return True
